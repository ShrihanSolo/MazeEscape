# MazeEscape

#### _Can you escape the maze?_  
You awaken in the dark.   
The faint glow of a lightly flickering lamp your only company.  
A creepily scrawled note sits at your feet: escape the maze, and live to see another day.   
But every footstep you take, and the haunting sound of stalking ghosts draws ever nearer, tracking your light down.

**Find the keys. Get out.**
